# Data sounds

This is a sound visualization of average temperatures in Hong Kong in the past
131 years. Go to the [live demo](http://datasounds.initiumlab.com/).

## Deploy it yourself

You don't actually need to deploy it. Just put the `static` folder under a HTTP
server. However, the repo do contain a Docker deployment toolchain, if you want
to use:

```bash
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
