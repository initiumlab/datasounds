# Data sounds

This is a sound visualization of average temperatures in Hong Kong in the past
131 years. Go to the [live demo](http://datasounds.initiumlab.com/).

## Deploy it yourself

You need to use `bower` to install the necessary dependencies first. After that,
use `npm` to install the Node.js dependencies. Wait patiently.

This project is internal, so only people with specific rights could deploy. If
you have access to the internal showcase server, run `grunt deploy:staging`. If
you have access to the Github page repository, which is used for "production
deployment", run `grunt deploy:gh-pages`.
